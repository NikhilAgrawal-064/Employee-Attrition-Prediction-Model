# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-Model
A machine learning model to predict employee attrition based on various factors such as job satisfaction, work environment, salary, and personal demographics. This project leverages datasets, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to identify employees who may leave an organization.
# Project Objectives
Data Exploration: Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, encode categorical variables, and scale features to prepare them for model building.
Model Building: Build a logistic regression model to predict employee attrition, serving as a baseline for future improvement.
Result Analysis: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and visualise feature importance to understand key factors influencing attrition.
